# Product-Sales-Analysis

### Hello!!

This repository showcases the project that earned me my [DataCamp Professional Certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0023790871318). For this project, I was tasked with analyzing sales data for Pens and Printers, a company specializing in high-quality office products for large organizations. While they donâ€™t produce their own products, they sell a wide range of itemsâ€”from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitorsâ€”sourced from other companies.

Recently, Pens and Printers launched a new line of office stationery and tested three different sales strategies: targeted email, phone calls, and a combination of both.

- Email: Customers in this group received an initial email about the new product line, followed by a second email three weeks later. This method required minimal effort from the sales team.

- Call: In this group, customers were personally called by a sales representative, with each call lasting around 30 minutes.

- Email and Call: This hybrid method involved sending the product email first, followed by a call one week later to discuss the customer's needs and how the new product could benefit them. The call was around 10 minutes long.

The executive team needed a quick analysis of the effectiveness of these sales strategies and asked for insights on the following:

*   How many customers were reached by each strategy?

* What does the revenue distribution look like overall and by each method?

* Was there any difference in revenue trends over time for each method?

* Based on the results, which method should we continue using? Some strategies require more time, so it's important to determine whether the results justify the time spent.

* Are there any notable differences between customer groups that could provide valuable insights?
